# tictactoe
The tic tac toe project in the Odin Project

design ideas:

* I currently have a small border indicating which colour the player is. When hovering over a grid I 
would like to be able to tell which player it is by having a trasparent colored marker show on the surface.
When the marker is down the marker should be in the players color.

*The congratulations message should be comepletely in the players color.
